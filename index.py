# Welcome back to Tails from the Wild. Iâ€™m Leo the Lion â€” king of the savannah, protector of the pride.
# And Iâ€™m Riley the Rabbit â€” burrow boss, carrot connoisseur, and part-time podcast producer!
# Today, we tackle a serious topic â€” why our planet is begging for help.
# Yeah! I mean, the trees are whispering, the rivers are shrinking, and the bees? Buzzing out of town!
# Once, I roared across green plains. Now, I step on plastic wrappers.
# I found a soda can in my burrow yesterday! I thought it was a shiny mushroomâ€¦ until it hissed at me.
# Deforestation, pollution, climate changeâ€¦ Itâ€™s not just a problem for humans. Weâ€™re all in this jungle together.
# So what can YOU do, listener? Plant a tree! Pick up litter! Switch to eco-batteries! Say no to single-use lettuce bags!
# I think you meant plastic bags, Riley.
# Oops. Lettuce is fine. Eat more of that, too.
# If we donâ€™t protect natureâ€¦ there wonâ€™t be a wild left to podcast from.
# And that, my furry friends, would be a real tragedy.
# Stay wild. Stay green. And stop throwing trash in our streams!
